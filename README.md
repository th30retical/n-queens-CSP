# N-Queens CSP

Update 1: I did most of the program in Java. But it doesn't actually spit out the right answer.
The program properly calculated the number of conflicts in each row of its column.
But when it's current position's conflicts are the same as the other position's conflicts it stays the same.And doesn't switch.
I'll try to add some comments later. Convert it Python, if you can. I'll convert it later, if I have time. Feel free to change it up.
